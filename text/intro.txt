Fixed gear cycling is more than just a mode of transportation; it's a lifestyle, an art form, and a statement of individuality. At its core, it embodies simplicity and a deep connection with the bike. Unlike conventional bicycles, fixed gear bikes lack the freewheel mechanism, meaning that the pedals are in constant motion as long as the wheels are turning. This creates an unparalleled sense of control and engagement with the road, making every ride a unique experience.
